# Group-410_Tomato_Detection
Optical sorting is used in various industries, where colour, size and shape can be used to group the products. In this project a prototype for proving the feasibility of an optical sorting system using color threshold to detect and reject green tomatoes was developed. The system is implemented as an embedded system with a line scan camera, three 8-bit ADCs, and an FPGA development board. The system is capable of running at 8.2 M pixels a second which corresponds to the pixel density of 1.67 pixels mm in the proposed setup. A UART module was developed to act upon user input and to log results while an external screen was implemented to show the output in the form of arms activated and the intermediate results with the true and false values from the threshold analysis. The code is written in VHDL using Vivado 2022.2 and the FPGA development board used is the CMOD A7 35T. Testing of the prototype was done by having test images roll down on a tv screen upon which the line scan camera was positioned. Although being bottlenecked by the limited brightness of the tv screen, an accuracy of respectively 100 % and 97 % was achieved.
